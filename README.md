ToME Tips
=========

Auto-generated web-based spoilers for [ToME](http://te4.org/).

Development instructions:

1. Make sure that you have Lua, [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and a Git command-line client installed.  The current build scripts use symlinks and so require Cygwin or a Unix-like operating system.
2. Run `make`.  This will automatically clone the [ToME repository](http://git.net-core.org/darkgod/t-engine4) and generate spoilers from the most recent ToME release.
3. Check the Makefile for switching between release and development versions of ToME, pretty-printing JSON spoiler information for debugging, and more.
