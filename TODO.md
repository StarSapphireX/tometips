Physical Power doesn't show up in, e.g., Sunder Arms
Permalink to individual talents
Extract Gems isn't working properly
Jumpgate doesn't correctly show talent level effects (but it doesn't in ToME either)
Correct masteries for, e.g., racial talents
Talents by stat for Wave of Power, prodigies
"View Source" link
"Empty Hand" and Hunted! scales by level
Clean up inscriptions
Color-code resource usage, to match ToME?
Fearscape shows 5 drain vim but not 90 vim
Try improving pluralization for, e.g., Reload - avoid saying "shot, shots, shots, shots, shots"
Category link doesn't work correctly (only on first load?) - expand an item, then click a link beneath it, nothing happens
Some IDs are duplicated - e.g., Cursed -> Rampage -> Rampage - clicking on side nav causes first talent to expand
Hide Spells -> Other -> Charms
Hide talents: Base, Race
Better makefile ("make clean") - but that means we need a consistent OS environment
